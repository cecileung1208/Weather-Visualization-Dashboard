Data is more powerful when we share it with others! Let's take what we've learned about HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the analysis we've done.


## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

Visualization dashboard website will be created  with plotting [weather data](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Web-Design-Web-Visualization-Dashboard/blob/master/Resources/cities.csv).<br>

In building this dashboard, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

### Website Requirements
For reference, see the [Screenshots](#screenshots) section below.

The website must consist of 7 html pages and 1 style page in total, including:

**1. A [Landing page](#landing-page) containing:**

  - An explanation of the project.
  - Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.
  - See the [index.html file](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Web-Design-Web-Visualization-Dashboard/blob/master/index.html) for the html codes.

**2. Four [Visualization pages](#visualizations-page), each with:**

  - A descriptive title and heading tag.
  - The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  - A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
  - See the [max_temp.html file](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Web-Design-Web-Visualization-Dashboard/blob/master/max_temp.html), [humidity.html file](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Web-Design-Web-Visualization-Dashboard/blob/master/humidity.html), [cloudiness.html file](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Web-Design-Web-Visualization-Dashboard/blob/master/cloudiness.html), and [wind_speed.html file](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Web-Design-Web-Visualization-Dashboard/blob/master/wind_speed.html) for the html codes.


**3. A [Comparisons page](#comparisons-page) that:**

  - Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  - Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
  - The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.
  - See the [comparisons.html file](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Web-Design-Web-Visualization-Dashboard/blob/master/comparisons.html) for the html codes.


**4. A [Data page](#data-page) that:**

  - Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
  - The table must be a bootstrap table component. 
  - The data must come from exporting the [.csv file](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Web-Design-Web-Visualization-Dashboard/blob/master/Resources/cities.csv) as HTML, or converting it to HTML. Try using a tool you already know, pandas. Pandas has a nifty method approprately called [to_html](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Web-Design-Web-Visualization-Dashboard/blob/master/Resources/Cities%20Table%20HTML%20Coversion.ipynb) that allows you to generate a HTML table from a pandas dataframe.
  - See the [data.html file](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Web-Design-Web-Visualization-Dashboard/blob/master/data.html)
 
**5. Style Sheet**

  - This is to store default settings for the html files.  
  - Settings include fonts, padding, background colour, formats for resizing the browser etc for the header and paragraph text, navigation bar, containers, column sizes, footer.
  - Details are in the [style.css file](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Web-Design-Web-Visualization-Dashboard/blob/master/style.css)
